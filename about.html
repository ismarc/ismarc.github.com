  <h3>About</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>I'm Matt Brace, a developer in Austin, TX.  I have far too many
  interests to enumerate them all here, but generally cover working on
  classic cars, computers/technology and music.  I very much enjoy
  tinkering with things and discovering how they work and will
  frequently try things that most folks would consider impossibly
  difficult just for the challenge.</p>
